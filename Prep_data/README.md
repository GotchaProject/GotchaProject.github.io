# Gotcha Preprocessed Data for Gait analysis

Dataset scaled ([-1, 1]) into 50, 100 and 150 buckets using the following code:

data_1_Y, where Y stands for:

	- 0 —> Distance: [0,1] according to 18 Pose Keypoints
	- 1 —> Distances: [0,1], [1,8] and [1,11] according to 18 Pose Keypoints
	- 2 —> Distances: [0,1], [1,2] and [1,5] according to 18 Pose Keypoints
	- 3 —> Distances: [0,1], [1,2], [1,5], [1,8] and [1, 11] according to 18 Pose Keypoints
	- 4 —> Distances: [0,1], [0,14], [0,15], [1, 2], [1, 5], [1,8], [2,3], [3,4], [5,6], [6,7] and [1,11] according to 18 Pose Keypoints
